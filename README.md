# Adult-Income-Prediciton-Model
This repository hosts a predictive model designed for income prediction, categorizing individuals into two groups: ">50k" or "<=50k" based on a range of features. The primary objective of this model is to support demographic and economic analysis, facilitating the identification of individuals with the potential for higher income.
If you're interested in exploring income trends, patterns, and demographics, this model can be a valuable addition to your toolkit. Clone the repository and start making predictions to gain insights into income potential.
Feel free to contribute and enhance the capabilities of this open-source project as we work together to refine the art of income prediction and analysis.
